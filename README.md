# Bus Ticket Reservation System

This is a simple **Bus Ticket Reservation System** implemented in **C**. It allows users to manage bus routes, book tickets, cancel reservations, check seat availability, and perform seat exchanges. The system employs basic graph traversal algorithms such as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** for finding routes and managing seat availability.

## Features

- **Route Management**:
  - Adds and manages bus routes between various bus stops.
  - Allows finding routes using BFS or DFS.
  
- **Ticket Booking**:
  - Books tickets by selecting a bus, choosing a seat, and providing passenger details.
  
- **Ticket Cancellation**:
  - Allows the user to cancel a booked ticket by specifying bus and seat information.
  
- **Seat Availability & Management**:
  - Checks available seats for specific routes.
  - Allows users to exchange seats or transfer to a different seat.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Algorithms**: BFS, DFS
- **Data Structures**: Graph, Queue, Stack
